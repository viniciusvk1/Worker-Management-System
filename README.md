# *Worker Management System*

This is a Java program that allows you to manage information about workers, their contracts, and their earnings. The program uses the classes "Worker", "Department", "HourContract", and "WorkerLevel" to create and store information related to the worker.

### *How it works*

The program starts by asking the user to enter the department name and the worker's information, including name, skill level, base salary, and number of contracts. The user then enters the details of each work contract, including the date, hourly rate, and duration in hours.

The program stores all this information in HourContract objects and adds them to a list of contracts associated with the worker. With this information, the program is able to calculate the total earnings of the worker in a specific month and year specified by the user.

### *Requirements*

The program was developed in Java and requires the installation of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run it.

### *How to run*

To run the program, simply run the "Program" class from your Java development environment or run the provided JAR file.

When you start the program, follow the instructions provided in the console to enter the department and worker's data, as well as the data for each work contract.

### *Getting Started*
